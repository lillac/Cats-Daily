This cat has a piece of bread on its head, and all of the other cats are sooooo jealous!<br><br>
We asked this cat what it felt like to be internet famous, and he replied with, and I quote 
    <q>Meow, meow meow meow meow, purr</q>
    Translation: It feels quite amazing, purr.<br><br>

<p>
This cat is in a box. Look at how cute it is!<br><br>

This cat is a very special cat, because it has the ability to fit into any sized box. His parents must be so proud of him!<br><br>

We even interviewed them! His Mum said 
<q>Meow, meow meow</q> 
Translation: I'm very proud of him. And his dad said
<q>Meow, meow meow, meow meow</q> 
Translation: Our son is an amazing cat, and we love his work.

<br>
<p>This cat is smiling and it looks really cute! Everyone who looks at it is instantly filled with joy and happiness!
<br> <br>
We asked this cat a very simple question, "How do you smile so well?" and he replied with 
<q>Meow, meow meow, meow meow purr</q> 
<br><br>
Translation: It took me many weeks of practice, but it it all paid off, purr.
